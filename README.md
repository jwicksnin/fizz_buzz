This is Fizz Buzz!

For the first, simple Fizz Buzz, I borrowed the idea of an empty string to be logged later from my partner, Dan.  Otherwise, for the extendible version, I decided to use an object constructor that would take any interger and any string, create a new object, then pass it through the original function as a parameter.  

Update: Decided to make more extensible. Now we can add any amount of integers with corresponding strings to an array.  The function takes the array and a limit as parameters.  Then, using two for loops, the function iterates to the limit and through the array for each number.  Much shorter and cleaner!
